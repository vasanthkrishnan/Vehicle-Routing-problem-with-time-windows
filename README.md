# Vehicle-Routing-Problem-with-time-windows
## Introduction

The Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) Visualization Project is designed to solve and visualize the complex logistics problem of routing multiple vehicles to service a set of customers, each with specific time constraints. The primary objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by the fleet of vehicles while ensuring that all customers are visited within their designated time windows and that vehicle capacity constraints are not violated.

This project leverages advanced algorithms, such as the Clarke-Wright Savings Algorithm and the Genetic Algorithm, to optimize routes efficiently. It integrates mapping services to provide a visual representation of the routes, enhancing the understanding and analysis of the solutions generated.

Key features of this project include:
- **Algorithm Flexibility:** Supports multiple algorithms for route optimization, allowing users to compare results and choose the most effective solution for their specific needs.
- **Interactive Visualization:** Provides a dynamic map interface to visualize routes, vehicle movements, and customer locations.
- **User-Friendly Input Forms:** Allows users to easily input and modify customer details, including location coordinates, demand, and time windows.
- **Detailed Vehicle Information:** Displays comprehensive details about each vehicle, such as total distance traveled and remaining capacity.

This tool is particularly useful for logistics and transportation companies looking to optimize their delivery routes, reduce operational costs, and improve service efficiency.
